About plugins
-------------

Hydrogen now support extensions of type
`org.freedesktop.LinuxAudio.LadspaPlugin`. Currently they depend on
freedesktop 19.08 (which the KDE 5.14 runtime depend on).

So careful consideration should be to update the runtime as this will
remove the extensions that the user might have installed and expect.
