About plugins
-------------

Hydrogen now support extensions of type
`org.freedesktop.LinuxAudio.Plugins`. Currently they depend on
freedesktop 21.08 (which the KDE 5.15-21.08 runtime depend on).

So careful consideration should be to update the runtime as this will
remove the extensions that the user might have installed and expect.
